## An example from Fisheaters

The person at the top of the user list types a word, and the person just under him types a word that begins with the last letter of the word typed. This can be done with States, countries, animals, or any given category, such as Song titles, Movie titles, Catholicism. An example using song titles:

Leader:

It Had to Be You
Player 2:    Under the Double Eagle
Player 3:  Everytime You Go Away
Player 4:    Yellow Rose of Texas

## Modification

The game starts at a specific time of the day (8 pm for example). There will be a countdown to the start of the game and players are given equal numbers of **points**. A player either buy more points or invite other users to join the game in order to earn more points.

A Bot starts the game by posting a random word, then chooses a random player to reply by starting his sentence with the last letter of the word. That player then selects another player at random. A chosen player will have limited time to reply and this time reduces after each round. 

Player losses one point if that player uses a word that has already been used in that round and two points if the first word doesn't start with the last letter.
